**Project**

 I used with SQL +Tableau integration to create a Dashboard for Obama's Tweets and Trump's Tweets with the help of SQL queries and visualizing in Tabluea
 for answering the following questions:

- What are the common hours for posting?
- The average tweet length (in words) per post
- Content of tweets by common words

**Conclusion**

- Hours:
- Trump acted in the evening. Most of his influence was in the afternoon and afternoon. Before the presidency he was very active at night but these are not the hours that motivated people to respond
He was in sync with the crowd.
- 130 words on average

- Obama acted during the day. In the morning he managed to motivate people to action and in the afternoon when he was not active then the posts he published motivated more people.
- 115 words on average

- content:
- Obama as president has spoken to the American citizen population and burning issues on the agenda and promoted his goals as president.
  After the presidency he targeted a different population, and his concepts changed. Tailored to a different readership.

- Trump before the presidency aimed for a specific goal and that was the terminology he used. Talked about rivals on camps, states, elections, created slogans. When the        terminology was chosen it did not change much because it already existed. He kept talking and tailoring the content to the audience, and talked about the hot topics to promote the messages.
-"fake News" is created in his presidency.
